NEURAL NETWORKS FROM SCRATCH IN RAW PYTHON

The following is a classification model using synthetic spiral data coded using object oriented programming in raw python. The only dependencies are Numpy and Matplotlib for display. Pytorch for training on GPU.

I have also included a Tensorflow implementation of the same neural network architecture using the same Spiral Data.
